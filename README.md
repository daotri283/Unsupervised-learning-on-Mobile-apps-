# Unsupervised-learning-on-Mobile-apps-
There are millions of mobile apps. I was tasked with analyzing app download behavior as well as other information related to consumers through data that was collected through a survey. My goal as a data science consultant to the marketing department is to segment users based on unsupervised machine learning techniques. I have also included my insights through a pdf file. 
The Step that I have taken to solve the problem: 
Step 1: Clean up the data
Step 2: remove demographic information before PCA/clustering because behavioral and demographic data should not be mixed as they are very different things.
Step 3: Unsupervised learing with the combination of PCA and Clustering 
Step 4: Interprete the results based on the top correlations (i.e. the top five) for each factor loading
